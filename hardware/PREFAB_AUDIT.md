# PowerMOD mount board — pre-fab audit (2026-07-17)

Full verification of `powermod.kicad_pcb` (renamed from powermod_mount 2026-07-17) against `netlist.py`, datasheets,
and fab constraints. Method + findings recorded so a re-audit after any change
can rerun the same checks.

## Checks performed and results

| Check | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Board ↔ netlist | per-pad diff script (every pad's net vs `netlist.py`) | 212/212 pads exact, 11 NCs correct, no extras |
| IC pinouts | datasheet re-verification, pin by pin | ATtiny1616 SOIC-20 ✓, TPS63020 ✓, TP4056 ✓, BM8563(=PCF8563) ✓, XC6206 ✓, BSS138 ✓, AON7407 ✓, 1N4148WS ✓ |
| FB divider | VFB=0.5V; R24=180k, R25=1M, R26=620k | JP2 open **5.000V**, closed **3.278V** |
| ADC ranges | 330k/1M divider | VBAT 4.2→1.042V; VBUS 5.25→1.303V (**needs 1.5V ref, 1.1V clips**) |
| Power path | state-walk USB-in / battery-only / unplug / boot | correct; TP4056 charges undisturbed (proper load sharing) |
| Off-state drain | budget sum | ~7.5µA total |
| Width rules | `.kicad_dru` fires (4 hits = U3 QFN necks, intrinsic) | enforced |
| Paste | all 232 SMD pads; EPs windowed 65% (unnamed aperture pads) | ✓ |
| Gerbers/drills | kicad-cli export smoke test; drills ≥0.3mm | ✓ 21 files, 4 layers |

## Findings

1. **VBACKUP back-drain (design flaw)** — supercap discharges through
   R27(1k)+JP1 into the dead 3V3 rail at ~3mA exactly when backup is needed;
   0.47F flat in minutes vs the RTC's 0.25µA. **Fix APPLIED 2026-07-17: D5
   (1N4148WS) in series: 3V3→R27→D5→JP1** (new net CHG_JPD; D5 at (58.6,31.0)
   rot 90 between R27 and JP1; netlist.py + board both updated, pad-diff 214/214
   clean). Supercap tops at ~2.85V, RTC sees ~2.5V on backup (keeps time to
   1.0V — fine). BOM: order one extra 1N4148WS (5 total with D3/D4… D3, D4, D5).
2. **U3 EP had zero PGND vias within 3.5mm** (FIXED 2026-07-17: 2 vias placed
   in the EP's unpasted center strip at (38.55, 8.15/8.95)). The TPS63020 EP
   *is* the power ground return of the 4A switching loop.

## BOM obligations (no DRC can catch these)

- **PLCC4 LED pinout varies by manufacturer** — pad map A_RED/K/A_GRN/K on
  1/2/3/4 must match the ordered part.
- **Green LED Vf**: InGaN green (Vf≈3.0V) gives 0.5mA through 560Ω = dim.
  Order yellow-green (Vf≈2.1V) or drop R21/R23 to ~220Ω.
- **Crystal must be CL=12.5pF** (BM8563 internal load caps assume it; a
  6/7pF 3215 part runs fast).
- **LCSC numbers unverified offline**: confirm C15483=TPS63020DSJR,
  C382139=TP4056(CE variant), C2891852=ATtiny1616-SN, C176756=AON7407,
  C5446=XC6206P332MR, C52895=BSS138, C194063=BM8563.

## Firmware contract (hardware assumes these)

1. ADC reference **1.5V** (1.1V clips VBUS_DIV at 5.25V input).
2. Internal pull-up on PA2 (button has no external pull-up).
3. Poll VBUS_DIV; **drop Q1_GATE_DRV when VBUS disappears** (hardware allows
   a brief battery→USB backfeed window through Q1 until firmware reacts).
4. CONV_EN idles low via R14 → Pi is off until firmware enables (by design).

## Accepted minor notes

- 56k Rp on J2 advertises 500mA to compliant C-C sinks (22k would advertise
  1.5A); C-to-microB cables ignore CC anyway.
- TP4056 dissipates up to 2W at low VBAT — thermal regulation folds back;
  expect <1A effective charge on hot days.
- CHG_CE 100k pull-up to 5V injects ~15µA into a tri-stated MCU pin (in spec;
  drive the pin in firmware).
- 122 silk-overlap warnings = refdes cosmetics; fabs clip silk over pads.

## Bring-up plan

Populate one board first. Bench supply, current-limited, on VBUS pads before
any battery. Verify: 3V3 rail → UPDI contact → VOUT=5.00V with CONV_EN driven
high → charge current 1A into a dummy load/cell → then battery + Pi.
